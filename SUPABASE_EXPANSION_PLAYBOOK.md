## Customer Case Studies by Entry Point → Expansion Path

### Auth Migration (High-Value Entry Point)

| Company | Industry | Entry Point | Expansion Signal | Enterprise Opportunity |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Kayhan Space** | Spacetech/AI | Migrated from Auth0 | 8x developer speed improvement | Full platform (DB + Auth + Edge Functions) |
| **Meshy** | Ecommerce/AI | Auth0 cost reduction | 3D asset generation at scale | Storage + Auth + Vector for AI features |
| **Mobbin** | Design Tools | Migrated 200K users from Firebase | Design library scale | Database + Auth + Storage |
| **Juniver** | Healthcare | Switched from Firebase | HIPAA compliance needs | Enterprise compliance package |

**Expansion Play**: Auth migrations create stickiness. Once auth is moved, pitch database consolidation ("why pay for two vendors?") and compliance features.

---

### Database Migration (Enterprise-Ready)

| Company | Industry | Entry Point | Expansion Signal | Enterprise Opportunity |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Phoenix Energy** | Enterprise | MongoDB → Postgres | Zero-downtime migration | Enterprise SLA + support |
| **Bree** | Fintech | Fauna → Supabase | 10x performance gains | Realtime + Edge Functions for fintech |
| **Rally** | Fintech | New build, 3-month launch | Pan-European expansion | Multi-region, compliance |
| **HappyTeams** | Analytics | Heroku → Supabase (30 min!) | Team growth | Pro → Team tier upgrade |

**Expansion Play**: Database migrations prove Supabase can handle production workloads. Upsell Realtime for live dashboards, Edge Functions for custom logic, Vector for AI features.

---

### AI/Vector Use Cases (High Growth)

| Company | Industry | Entry Point | Expansion Signal | Enterprise Opportunity |
|---------|----------|-------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Humata** | AI/Analytics | Vector database | 4x cost savings vs competitors | Enterprise vector + storage |
| **Chatbase** | AI/SaaS | AI chatbot builder | $1M revenue in 5 months | Scale + enterprise features |
| **Quivr** | AI/SaaS | Open-source "second brain" | 5,000 vector databases launched | Enterprise self-hosted option |
| **Berri AI** | AI/Dev Tools | Migrated from AWS RDS | LLM platform productivity | Vector + Edge Functions |
| **Firecrawl** | AI/SaaS | Switched from Pinecone | Documentation search | Vector + Auth + Storage |
| **Markprompt** | AI/SaaS | GDPR-compliant chatbots | Compliance requirements | Enterprise compliance + vector |
| **Udio** | Media/AI | Built on Supabase day one | AI music creation at scale | Full platform enterprise |

**Expansion Play**: AI companies need Vector, but also need Auth (user management), Storage (assets), and Edge Functions (inference endpoints). Package deal.

## Expansion Conversation Starters

### By Current Usage

**If they're using Auth only:**
> "I see you're using Supabase Auth. Most teams using Auth at your scale also consolidate their database—cuts vendor management and improves performance. Want to see how Kayhan Space got 8x faster after consolidating?"

**If they're using Database only:**
> "Your API call volume suggests you might benefit from Edge Functions for custom endpoints. Maergo reduced their codebase by 90% moving logic to Edge Functions. Interested?"

**If they're using Vector:**
> "Vector users typically also need Auth for user management and Storage for assets. Humata saved 4x on costs by consolidating. Should we look at a platform deal?"

**If they're on Free/Pro with growing team:**
> "I noticed you've added 3 team members in the last month. Team tier gives you SSO, audit logs, and priority support. eXp Realty scaled to 2,000 users on Team—want to discuss?"

### By Industry Vertical

| Industry | Lead With | Proof Point |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Fintech** | Compliance, Realtime | Rally (3-month launch), Bree (10x perf) |
| **Healthcare** | HIPAA, compliance | Juniver (Firebase → Supabase) |
| **AI/ML** | Vector, Edge Functions | Humata (4x savings), Chatbase ($1M/5mo) |
| **Real Estate** | Scale, non-technical users | eXp Realty (2,000 builders) |
| **Media/Events** | Realtime, scale | Shotgun (3M users, 83% cost reduction) |
| **Dev Tools** | Reliability, API performance | Resend (millions of emails/day) |

---

## Red Flags → Expansion Blockers

| Signal | What It Means | How to Address |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Single developer, side project | Not enterprise | Nurture, check back in 6 months |
| Agency with many small projects | Partner opportunity, not enterprise | Discuss partner program |
| Stuck on free tier for 6+ months | No budget or no growth | Qualify harder on next touch |
| Using only one feature | May not see full value | Demo other features, show integrations |

---

## Key Metrics for Scoring

### Internal Signals (from Supabase platform)
- **API calls growth** > 100% MoM = Hot
- **Team members added** > 2 in 30 days = Expanding
- **Features adopted** > 3 = Platform stickiness
- **Billing tier upgrade** = Budget confirmed
- **Edge Function deployments** = Technical sophistication

### External Signals (from enrichment)

- **Competitor mentioned in job posts** = Evaluating alternatives

---

## Summary: The Expansion Formula

```
Entry Point (Auth OR Database OR Vector)
    ↓
Usage Growth (API calls, team members, projects)
    ↓
Feature Expansion (add Auth → add Realtime → add Edge Functions)
    ↓
Tier Upgrade (Free → Pro → Team)
    ↓
Enterprise Conversation (SSO, compliance, SLA, support)
```

**The AE's job**: Identify which stage they're at, and accelerate them to the next one.

Option 1: Shotgun (Events/Ticketing)                                                                                  
  - 3M+ users, 83% cost reduction                                                                                       
  - The scenario: They started as a ticketing platform, scaled to millions. What would an interactive "your event is    
  about to go viral" simulator look like? Show: concurrent connections, Realtime load, when they'd need enterprise SLAs.
  - Why it's good: Events have spiky traffic. Visual, tangible, urgent.                                                 
                                                                                                                        
  ---                                                                                                                   
  Option 2: Pebblely (AI Image Generation)                                                                              
  - 1M users in 7 months                                                                                                
  - The scenario: AI startup growing fast. Show: image generations per day → storage costs → when Vector becomes        
  necessary for search → when they need enterprise support.                                                             
  - Why it's good: AI is hot. Shows the Auth + Storage + Vector bundle upsell.                                          
                                                                                                                        
  ---                                                                                                                   
  Option 3: Kayhan Space (Spacetech, Auth0 Migration)                                                                   
  - 8x developer speed after migrating from Auth0 + Amazon RDS                                                          
  - The scenario: Migration ROI over time. Show: current Auth0 costs, projected Supabase costs, developer hours saved,  
  feature consolidation timeline.                                                                                       
  - Why it's good: Migration stories are repeatable. Every company on Auth0/Firebase is a prospect.                     
                                                                                                                        
  ---                                                                                                                   
  Option 4: eXp Realty (Enterprise Scale)                                                                               
  - 2,000 non-technical employees building apps                                                                         
  - The scenario: Seat-based expansion. Show: user adoption curve, when SSO becomes mandatory, when audit logs matter,  
  compliance checkboxes.                                                                                                
  - Why it's good: Classic enterprise motion. Seats = revenue.                                                          
                                                                                                                        
  ---                                                                                                                   
  My lean: Shotgun or Pebblely — both have dramatic growth curves that visualize well.

  Does this framing land? Should I build this as /scenarios/ai-startup (generic enough to reuse) or keep it             
  Pebblely-specific for the demo?                                                                                       
                                                                                                                        
❯ yes I like this framing but take a moment to reconsider all of supabases product and service offerings, offer         
  more of these options to the AI startup that either manages scale (cost savings) and provides more growth             
  (revenue)
